                            Retropie is an emulation operating system that can run on many systems but as it's name suggests, it was originally designed for the
                            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspbery Pi boards</a>.
                            I recently purchased a Raspberry Pi 5 (as of writting) and wanted to push it to it's absolute limits to play the most recent consoles that it "supports" including the Gamecube and the Wii.
                            As such this guide will be focused on the Raspberry Pi 5 but i will be adding side comments for the Raspberry Pi 4 and will update this article for any future boards or updates to the 
                            operating system.

                            This guide will cover how to push the Raspberry Pi's performance to be able to play the most recent consoles as best as possible. This process includes installing Retropie, 
                            overclocking, modifying the RAM split, installing emulators such as dolphin (Wii/Gamecube), accessing the hidden console and desktop enviornment, and using that enviornment to configure
                            those emulators.

            <hr>
            <p><h4>
                There are two ways to install Retropie. You can install retropie with the official <a hraf="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>, or you can 
                build Retropie on Raspberry Pi OS. However, I don't know if you can complete this full guide with the official image because as of writing there is no official image for the Raspberry Pi 5.
